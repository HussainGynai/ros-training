* What are we doing today?
- Sensor of the day: Lidar
- Coordinate Frames and Transformations mk.1
- ROS 2: "The Electric Boogaloo" or "How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love XML"

* Meet the lidar!
- This sensor shines a laser light in circles and measures the return times
  from the pulses to give us a 3D model of our world
- Notice that the lidar has a *rotating* component. This makes them more
  fragile the a sensor like a camera, so *they should be handled with caution*.

* Pointclouds
- A pointcloud is a data structure for holding the results found by the
  lidar (X, Y, Z)
- This includes an array of points picked up from the the LIDAR and their
  cartesian coordinates relative to the LIDAR

* What does a pointcloud look like?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Pull out Jason's LIDAR and run rqt
#+END_NOTES
- Live demo time!

* Everything is Relative
- Points are given relative to the sensor's frame of reference
- Imagine a 3d coordinate frame with the x-axis facing the front of the lidar, the y-axis shooting off to the left, and the z-axis pointing straight up
-How do we move points in that frame to the global frame, where our robot exsists?
-Linear Transformations! (eww math)

* Insert Transformatios Slides Here, I suggest the ones from 3630 - they're pretty clear

* ROS Messages!
- Before, we set up a simple message type that held just a simple string.
- We'll see that again shortly.
- A ROS message is the object that holds the data that a node wants to send across ROS
- There are two main parts:
    - A Header, which holds meta information about the message, such as when it was sent
    - A Data field, which holds the actual information that we are interested in
    
* Headers - Timestamps 
- Headers are super useful, escpecially for their timestamps.
- Since the robot is running all of its nodes and sensors in parallel, it is possible to get messages that are out of date
- Consider a robot pulbishing it's position twice a second and publishing pointclouds every second. 
- Performing time-blind computation on those pointclouds would result in bad mapping, as the robot could be facing a different direction than when the pointcloud was measured.

* Headers - Timestamp
- By syncing the timestamps of the position and pointcloud messages, we can correct (mostly) for this error - while messages might not be exactly in sync the difference in time between the closest messgages is often neglible.

* Headers - FrameID
- In addition, headers contain a frame id which can specify which reference frame this message was created in, which allows our code to easily transform data across our robot's reference frames.

* Data
- The data contained wihin a message is dependent on that data type, so checking the ros docs is important in determining how to treat different messages.

* Data - Pointcloud
- We use ROS's PCL package to interface with the LIDAR, and get messages of
  type
  [[http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud.html][PointCloud]
- The array in the PointCloud contains data of type
  [[http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Point32.html][Point32]]
  
* How do we structure ROS projects?

- ROS code is built with a build tool called catkin, which itself sits on top
  of a build tool called CMake
- CMakeLists defines the structure of the package for the compiler, as well
  as linking the executable ROS nodes to the appropriate libraries (OpenCV,
  PCL, etc..)

* Some ROS Vocab
- A _node_ is a process running on your computer
    - you specify the behavior of the node with the C++ code you write
- Nodes _publish messages_ on a _topic_
    - A message is a data structure made up of fields. Messages can be
    primitive like booleans or ints, or they can contain other data
    structures like a PointCloud
    - Think of a topic as the mailbox to which the messages get delivered
- Nodes _subscribe_ to a topic to receive _callbacks_ when a new message
  appears
    - Subscribing to a topic entails telling ROS to call a function you
    define everytime a new message is published on this topic!

* A ROS Publisher - Setup

* Let's go back to PointCloud2
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Talk them through the layout of the message. Show them that messages can
consists of field which then consist of other fields. For example, click on
the header, which links to message definition for a header. Note that every
message should have a header
#+END_NOTES
- This is the particular pointcloud message we use in IGVC.
- Everyone visit the
  [[http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html][PointCloud2
  message declaration]]

* Takeaways from the message definition
- Messages should always have headers. Haveing a timestamp makes logging and
  debugging easier
- Messages contain fields of data, some of these fields also contain fields
  of data, as they are also message types
